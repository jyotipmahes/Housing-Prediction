This repo is my attempt to get familiar to the field of **regression** by attempting the **Housing Price Prediction** competition on **Kaggle**.
I perform *data cleaning, feature extraction* using `Boruta` and `PCA` so that data is ready to be fed to regression models. 
I have tried to compare the performance of various models such as `linear regression`, `tree`, `random forest` and `xgboost` to understand how they perform and estimate gain in performance if any. This exercise has helped me understand the implementation of these different models in R.
